Notes:
1. I have created migration files for customers,products,orders.
2. Added seeder file for customers and products, which feeds data based on csv file. on the customers csv file,
   for the column `registered_since` data is inaccurately given in the csv sheet in terms of name of days.
3. CRUD APIs are also created for orders & also created listing APIs for customers listing and product listing.
4. I have also attached postman collection file, after importing it, you can use all apis.
5. Passport package is used for APIs so except registration & login, every API needs token to run, which can be found on response of login API.
6. I have also created Basic test cases for PassportAuthController, which covers 100 % code coverage.
